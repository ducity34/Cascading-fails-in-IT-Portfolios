# IT-Project-fail-spread

- DOMINIK ULRICH -

This python code tries to run a cascading fail spread in IT projects within a broad IT portfolio (ITP). Similar to a virus spread, where individuals in society get infected with a virus and spread it through aquaintances, this IT virus spreads via dependencies. IT projects depend on eachother within the ITP, which increases the risk of a cascading failure due to e.g. a server breakdown or work delay within an IT project. 

The initial simulation builds on the basic SI cascade model and was further developed within the scope of my master thesis. The cascading model therefore further developed from SI -> SIR -> SIRS cascade model, following Kermack and McKendrick (1927) as well as Hethcote (1976).

It is my first GitHub repository and will be updated with all content over the past few weeks to open up the opportunity to further develop my work and to drive future research regarding this topic!
